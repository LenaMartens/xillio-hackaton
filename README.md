# xillio-hackaton

As part of the Xillio hackaton, we created a script that can commit all your local changes completely automatically. This means it generates a commit message for you! Based on the GitHub archives data, language models were trained that can randomly generate commit messages based on the file extensions you have changed. 

Right now there is no easy or elegant way to install it. You will have to copy the repository into the directory you want to commit from and run CommitApp.sh
